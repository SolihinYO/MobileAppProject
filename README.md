Introduction

University students often struggle to manage assignments, deadlines, and daily academic tasks efficiently. Many existing tools are either too complex or not tailored for student productivity. TaskifyU is a simple, web-based task management application designed to help students plan, organize, and track their academic tasks effectively. The system focuses on usability, clean UI, and productivity while being fully accessible through a web browser (Google Chrome).
