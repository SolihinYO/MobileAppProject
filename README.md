🚌 SchoolNow – Automated School Bus System (ASBS)
📌 Application Domain

Transportation / Education Technology / Safety Management

📖 Introduction

School transportation services in Malaysia often rely on manual attendance recording and cash-based fare collection, which can lead to errors, delays, and safety concerns. Parents frequently lack real-time information about their child’s bus status, while administrators face difficulties managing attendance, routes, drivers, and payments efficiently.

SchoolNow – Automated School Bus System (ASBS) is a mobile-based solution designed to modernize school bus operations using digital technologies. The system replaces manual processes with QR-based attendance, automated fare collection, and real-time bus tracking, ensuring safer, more efficient, and transparent school transportation management.

SchoolNow is developed using Flutter and cloud-based backend services, enabling parents, students, drivers, and administrators to interact through a single integrated platform.

❗ Problem Statement

School bus services in Malaysia commonly depend on manual attendance and payment processes. These traditional methods are inefficient and prone to human error, such as incorrect attendance records, delayed updates, and missing payment information.

In addition, there is limited real-time communication between parents, drivers, and school administrators. Parents often cannot confirm whether their children have safely boarded or exited the bus, increasing anxiety and reducing trust in the transportation system.

Manual fare collection also introduces risks such as lost records, incorrect payments, and difficulties in tracking service usage. Without a centralized digital platform, managing buses, routes, drivers, students, and payments becomes challenging.

Therefore, there is a strong need for a digital, integrated school bus management system that enhances safety, improves efficiency, reduces human error, and provides real-time information to all stakeholders.

🎯 Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to design and develop a mobile-based Automated School Bus System (ASBS) that improves the safety, efficiency, and reliability of school transportation services.

Specific objectives include:

To implement a QR-based tap-in and tap-out system for accurate student attendance tracking

To provide real-time bus location and trip status for parents

To enable digital fare collection and payment tracking

To support bus drivers with student pickup lists, routes, and trip records

To allow administrators to manage buses, drivers, students, routes, attendance, and payments from a centralized system
