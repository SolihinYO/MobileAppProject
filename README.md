## 📖 Introduction

School transportation services in Malaysia often rely on manual attendance tracking and cash-based fare collection. These traditional methods are inefficient, prone to human error, and provide limited visibility for parents regarding their children’s safety during daily school commutes.

**SchoolNow – Automated School Bus System (ASBS)** is a mobile-based application designed to modernize school bus operations by replacing manual processes with a digital, automated solution. The system integrates **QR-based attendance**, **automated fare collection**, and **real-time bus tracking** to improve safety, efficiency, and transparency for all stakeholders.

SchoolNow is developed using **Flutter**, allowing the application to run smoothly across multiple platforms while maintaining a user-friendly interface for parents, students, drivers, and administrators.

## ❗ Problem Statement

School bus services in Malaysia commonly depend on manual methods for recording student attendance and managing transportation fees. These processes are inefficient and often result in inaccurate records, delayed updates, and missing information.

Parents usually lack real-time confirmation of whether their children have safely boarded or exited the bus. This absence of visibility causes anxiety and reduces trust in the transportation system. Additionally, manual fare collection increases the risk of payment errors, lost records, and difficulty in monitoring service usage.

Without a centralized digital system, administrators face challenges in managing buses, drivers, routes, students, attendance, and payments efficiently. Therefore, a comprehensive digital solution is required to improve safety, reduce human error, and provide real-time information to all users.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to develop a **mobile-based Automated School Bus System (ASBS)** that enhances the safety, efficiency, and reliability of school transportation services.

The specific objectives are:
- To implement a **QR-based tap-in and tap-out system** for accurate student attendance tracking  
- To provide **real-time trip status and bus location updates** for parents  
- To enable **digital fare collection and payment monitoring**  
- To assist drivers with route details, student pickup lists, and trip records  
- To allow administrators to manage buses, drivers, students, routes, attendance, and payments through a centralized platform
